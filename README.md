# AI Portfolio Agent MVP

ProCogia's AI-powered portfolio management assistant that provides intelligent insights and real-time market analysis.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

The application works in **demo mode** without API keys, but you'll get the full experience with real data by configuring the APIs below.

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Install backend dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install frontend dependencies  
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Copy the example configuration
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your API keys:

```env
# AlphaVantage API Key (for real-time market data)
ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alphavantage_key_here

# Google Gemini API Key (for AI assistant functionality)  
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key_here
```

### 3. Run the Application

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
python main.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

Visit **http://localhost:3000** to use the application!

## ðŸ”‘ API Keys Setup

### AlphaVantage API (Real-time Market Data)

1. **Visit**: https://www.alphavantage.co/support/#api-key

3. **Get your API key** - Free tier includes:
   - 5 API requests per minute
   - 500 requests per day
   - Real-time stock quotes
4. **Add to .env**: `ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here`

**Without this key**: The app uses mock market data (AAPL: $175.23, GOOGL: $2634.50, MSFT: $347.89)

### Google Gemini API (AI Assistant)

1. **Visit**: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

   - No billing required for basic usage
   - Gemini Pro model access
5. **Add to .env**: `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here`

**Estimated cost**: **FREE** for MVP testing and development with generous limits.

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start:
```bash
# Check Python version (needs 3.9+)
python --version

# Reinstall dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run directly
cd backend && python main.py
```

### Frontend won't start:
```bash
# Check Node version (needs 16+)
node --version

# Clear cache and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm start
```

### API Issues:
- **AlphaVantage errors**: Check your API key and rate limits (5 requests/minute)
- **Gemini errors**: Verify API key is valid from Google AI Studio
- **CORS errors**: Make sure backend is running on port 8000
