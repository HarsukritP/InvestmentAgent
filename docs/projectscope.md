## API Integrations

### AlphaVantage API
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `TIME_SERIES_INTRADAY` - Real-time prices
  - `GLOBAL_QUOTE` - Current stock quotes
  - `SYMBOL_SEARCH` - Stock symbol lookup
  - `COMPANY_OVERVIEW` - Basic company information

### LLM Integration (OpenAI/Gemini)
- **Functions**:
  - `get_portfolio_summary()` - Portfolio overview
  - `get_stock_info(symbol)` - Stock details
  - `calculate_portfolio_performance()` - Performance metrics
  - `suggest_portfolio_actions()` - Basic recommendations

## Data Models

### User Portfolio
```python
{
  "user_id": "string",
  "holdings": [
    {
      "symbol": "string",
      "quantity": "number",
      "purchase_price": "number",
      "purchase_date": "datetime"
    }
  ],
  "cash_balance": "number",
  "created_at": "datetime",
  "updated_at": "datetime"
}
```

### Stock Data
```python
{
  "symbol": "string",
  "current_price": "number",
  "change": "number",
  "change_percent": "number",
  "volume": "number",
  "last_updated": "datetime"
}
```

## Security Considerations
- API key management and encryption
- User data protection
- Rate limiting for external API calls
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for frontend-backend communication

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Project setup and environment configuration
- Basic FastAPI backend with portfolio models
- React frontend with basic UI components
- AlphaVantage API integration
- Simple portfolio CRUD operations

### Phase 2: AI Integration (Weeks 3-4)
- LLM service integration (OpenAI/Gemini)
- Function calling implementation
- Chat interface development
- Basic portfolio analysis functions

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Weeks 5-6)
- Improved UI/UX with charts and visualizations
- Enhanced AI responses and recommendations
- Error handling and edge cases
- Performance optimization

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Advanced portfolio optimization algorithms
- Risk assessment and management
- News sentiment analysis integration
- Automated trading simulation
- Multi-portfolio management
- Advanced charting and technical analysis
- Mobile responsiveness
- User authentication and multi-user support
- Historical performance tracking
- Custom investment strategies
- Integration with additional data sources

## Technical Requirements

### Environment Setup
- Python 3.9+ with virtual environment
- Node.js 16+ for React development
- AlphaVantage API key (free tier: 5 API requests/minute, 500/day)
- OpenAI API key or Google Cloud account for Gemini

### Development Tools
- VS Code or PyCharm for development
- Postman for API testing
- Git for version control
- Docker for containerization (future)

## Risk Mitigation
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement caching and request throttling
- **Data Accuracy**: Add data validation and error handling
- **LLM Costs**: Monitor token usage and implement cost controls
- **Market Data Delays**: Clear user communication about data freshness
- **Security**: Secure API key storage and user data protection
